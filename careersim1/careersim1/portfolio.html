      support, travel, or healthcare.

      geolocation to provide real-time weather information for a user's current
      location. Include features like weather forecasts, temperature trends, and
      severe weather alerts. You can also integrate a map to visualize weather
      patterns.

      5. **Task and Project Management Tool:** Create a web-based project
      management tool that allows users to create tasks, assign them to team
      members, set due dates, and track project progress. Implement
      collaboration features like file sharing, comments, and notifications to
      enhance team productivity.
